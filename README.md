### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  My name is Thiago, my first contact with programming was when I was 15 years old, in a CNC programming course, I remember I liked it at the time. But it was at the college of Mechanical Engineering, programming Lego robots in C++ that's when it happened, the spark, but the life went on, it was always in my mind, always trying, studying as a hobby, but a little over a year and a half ago I decided to turn this love into my career, I started studying algorithms and object-oriented programming (OOP), creating a basis for my knowledge. After that I studied HTML and CSS, naturally, I went to JavaScript and earned my certificates at freeCodeCamp (Responsive Web Design Certification and Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification).

  I entered college again, this time in systems analysis and development, where I already had some excellent classes such as C programming language, database (MYSQL), and data structure. I also continued learning with extracurricular activities, Bootstrap, Yarn, NPM, Git, GitHub, currently I am taking the RocketSeat Bootcamp, where I am learning NodeJs, Express, RESTful API, Docker with Postgres, JSON Web Token and Bcrypt on the backend and React / ReactNative for the front end.

  Earlier this year I started my career as a software developer trainee, where I put into practice some of my knowledge and learned so many others such as Java, Groovy, JUnit, Activiti, GitLab and Postman. We work with agile methodology (SCRUM) and we have a Clean Code reading group. For the future, I plan to work in Europe and study Neural Networks and Big Data.
